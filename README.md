Semantic Management of Legal Texts

📌 Overview

This project is part of a thesis on Semantic Management of Legal Texts.  
It implements a semantic management system written in Java, built with Eclipse as a Maven project, and using the RDF4J framework to handle RDF data.

The system allows legal professionals (e.g., lawyers, legal clerks) to create, manage, and extend RDF models that represent legal resources such as laws, statutes, and legal provisions.  
All models are stored in Turtle (TTL) format and can be explored with ontology tools such as Protégé.

⚙️ Technologies Used

- Java (Maven Project) – Core implementation  
- RDF4J Framework – Semantic data management and RDF model handling  
- Turtle Serialization (TTL) – RDF model storage format  
- Protégé – Ontology inspection and validation  

🔧 Requirements

- Java 11 or later  
- Maven 3.6+  
- RDF4J Framework (managed automatically via Maven)  

🧩 System Functionality

RDF Model Management

- Create new RDF model: start a new semantic representation of a legal resource  
- Load existing RDF model: import and extend models already stored in the system  

Legal Element Handling

- Add elements: insert new legal elements (Chapter, Article, Section, Intend, Subintend, Paragraph) with  
  - Datatype properties (number, title, description, letter)  
  - Object properties (relationships with other elements, e.g., inclusion, modification, references, exceptions)  
- Remove elements: delete existing legal elements after reviewing their relations  
  - Note: Removing an element does not automatically delete related relationships; these remain in the RDF model for consistency  

Core Logic – `Legal_Element` (Abstract Class)

- Provides all methods for:  
  - Adding new elements with autogenerated unique 10-character identifiers  
  - Establishing valid parent-child relationships between legal elements  
  - Adding datatype properties and object properties with inverse relations  
  - Handling exceptions and references between legal elements  
  - Removing elements after listing and confirming their relations  

User Interaction

- Interaction currently takes place through the terminal (command-line interface)  
- The user is prompted step by step to manage legal data

📂Modify the model

Type Add to insert a new legal element

Type Remove to delete an element

Type Exit to close the system

Type Back to return to the previous menu

📂 Example RDF Model

An example RDF model (example.rdf) is included in the repository.
It can be opened and visualized with Protégé to explore classes, datatype properties, and object properties.

🚀 Future Improvements

Currently, the system operates via terminal interaction.
A proposed improvement is the development of a front-end application (web-based or desktop) to provide:

A more user-friendly graphical interface

Easier visual navigation of legal elements

Drag-and-drop management of relationships

Better integration with existing legal information systems

👤 Target Users

Lawyers

Legal clerks

Law office staff

Researchers in legal informatics and semantic technologies
